## Why You Should Learn PowerShell

The Bad News
    Big push by MS to use it
        Lots of cmdlets there to be used
    Sometimes it's the only way to solve a problem
        Active Directory Recycle Tools
    PowerShell abbrev (PoSh)
    PowerSHell toools are far better than the GUI
        (Dhcp Failover, Storage Space)

## Why you'll Like PowerShell
    It's automate-able
    PowerShell cmdlets are little like administrative legos
        Can be piped together
    Can get power ofd scripting without a script
        Scripting is an option 
        Non-trivial scripting in PowerShell is easier than in VBScript, Office VBA, C#

## Why CLI is Great
    Can gather a few cli tools into a file to run together always
    CLIs don't change as often as GUIs do
    GUIs tools are easier to use but CLIs give you more control

## CLI can be a real pain
    Documentation is often terrible
        mklink command is an example
    They are often silos when learning
        Learn one has little to no use in learning the next command
